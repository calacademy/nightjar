## High Level Credits

### Original Game
This game is based upon the University of Exeter's ["Where is that nightjar?"](https://github.com/nebogeo/where-is-that-nightjar) online citizen science game. The California Academy of Sciences developed this version in partnership with Exeter's [http://biosciences.exeter.ac.uk/](Centre for Ecology & Conservation), collecting and sharing gameplay data in support of its ongoing citizen science work.

### MEAN Stack Kit
This application was developed using Scotch.io's ["MEAN Stack Single Page Application Starter"](https://github.com/scotch-io/starter-node-angular).

### jQuery Timer Plugin
This application uses the ["TimerCircles"](https://github.com/wimbarelds/TimeCircles) jQuery plugin.
